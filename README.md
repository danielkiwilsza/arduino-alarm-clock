# Arduino Alarm Clock
Alarm clock code created for an Arduino Nano Every connected to a 4-digit 7-segment display and five buttons.

A personal project made on my own time but heavily reliant on the skills learned in ECE 299: Intro to ECE Design I, a course that used similar components to create an alarm clock but was not physically built.

Not meant for widespread use but rather to showcase coding ability and experience.
